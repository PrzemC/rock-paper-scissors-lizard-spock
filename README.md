# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game. *All hail Sam Kass. Hail.*

#### Rules:
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and *as it always has*, rock crushes scissors.

This is my humble attempt of implementation of this gem in Python.
